      <h1>Responsive Layouts don't have to be a struggle</h1>
      <p>If we work <em>with</em> the browser instead of fighting against it, it can go from a frustrating experience to smooth sailing. It takes a bit of a mindset shift to start working with the browser, as well as time and practice to learn how to implement things correctly, but always remember, if something isn't responsive, it's probably a line of CSS that <em>you</em> wrote that's causing the issue!</p>
    
      <p>Also, it can be hard to see what's going on, so adding background colors to things to help visualize everything is very useful!</p>
